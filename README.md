## What is Shadow Hunters?

Shadow Hunters is a famous RPG Card board game by Yasutaka Ikeda. 

The whole point of the game is to identify your opponents or allies! You are a Werewolf, a Vampire or a human who just caught in the middle of this ancient battle. But your identity remains secret until someone outs you through your actions and through Hermit cards or you reveal yourself to use your special ability. The key to victory is to identify your allies and enemies early. Survival! Once your identity is revealed, your enemies will attack without impunity using their special abilities or their equipment. This ancient battle comes to a head and only one group will stand victorious (or a civilian, in the right circumstances). 

## What is completed by now (v0.9)?
At this moment pretty much everything is completed and I am just working out on some minor bugs during the end of the game. Facebook Integration runs smoothly and a game of up to 5 players is possible. 

## What's next?
Make the game prettier: During development I mostly focused on how to make the game work and didn't give much attention to how it will look like. So, one of my plans it's to make the whole game prettier (for both the _start scene and the _project scene)

User Points and User Rewards: One of my plans for the future of this game is to implement some kind of reward system for the winners so that the user whould have a reason to come back.

Go Mobile: This game is mostly point and click, so a mobile implementation could be a good move  


## Some screens of the game (v0.9): 

Home Screen (Using an NGUI template for inserting user info - this will probably be replaced with Facebook Integration):
