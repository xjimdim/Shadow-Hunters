WARNING: This project is under heavy development right now (it has my full attention) so it is due to change A LOT.

## What is Shadow Hunters?

Shadow Hunters is a famous RPG Card board game by Yasutaka Ikeda. 

The whole point of the game is to identify your opponents or allies! You are a Shadow, a creature of the night, or a Hunter, a human whose job is to destroy supernatural creatures, or a civilian, a normal human just caught in the middle of this ancient battle. But your identity remains secret until someone outs you through your actions and through Hermit cards or you reveal yourself to use your special ability. The key to victory is to identify your allies and enemies early. Survival! Once your identity is revealed, your enemies will attack without impunity using their special abilities like Demolish, Teleport, and Suck Blood or equipment cards such as the Rusty Broad Ax or Fortune Brooch. This ancient battle comes to a head and only one group will stand victorious (or a civilian, in the right circumstances). 

## What is completed by now (v0.5)?
At this moment I have completed the basic "engine" of the game which allows the player to begin their round by rolling the dice, picking a card (if the area they landed on allows them to) and then ending their turn so that the next player can play. Also I made a starting screen (with NGUI) that players can input their info (but this is probably going to change after Facebook Integration). 

## What's next?
Pretty much the whole game :P 

Currently I am trying to get the company that published the boardgame to give me the original board and cards so as to incorporate them at the game. If they don't i will probably make my own cards and board (that will probably take quite some time). 

After that I am planning on integrating Facebook into the game. The idea is to have every player join a room (networking done by PhotonNetwork for unity) with their name and profile picture available to the other users throughout the game session. Once they are all ready to go the room master presses the start button (or there may be a system that waits for everyone to press a "ready!" button). After that the game is set, everyone gets their character card and they start playing. 

I also believe that a chat is CRUCIAL to this kind of games. Communication is key to a board game like this, where you are trying to identify who is who. 

So those are my first three goals at the moment... Once they are done version 1.0 will probably be complete (if everything goes smoothly).

If you have any ideas about the game please don't hesitate to contact me :)

## Language and game format
The game (board game design, card design etc) will be at its Greek format which looks something like this:

Because this is also going to be my graduation thesis project (right now I study Computer Science at Thessaloniki/Greece) I'm going to have to build this one in Greek. That means that the cards, the board and the UI elements of the game will be in Greek (at the final point). If you would like to take it and translate it to your native language you are free to do so. 

Also, you are free to download, copy and do whatever you want with everything that is in this project right now (v0.5). If the publishers of the game give me the original cards then I will not upload them, I will just replace them with dummy-cards.  

## Some screens of the very early version of the game: 

Home Screen (Using an NGUI template for inserting user info - this will probably be replaced with Facebook Integration):
